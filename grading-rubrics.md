## Grading Philosophy

### What We Assess

✅ **Understanding:**
- Can student explain what the code does?
- Can student modify and debug code?
- Does student understand the concepts?

✅ **Process:**
- Quality of prompts used with Cursor AI
- Iteration and improvement process
- Problem-solving approach
- Documentation quality

✅ **Functionality:**
- Does the code work as required?
- Are requirements met?
- Is the implementation clean?

### What We Don't Assess

❌ **Code Originality:**
- AI-generated code is expected
- Copying starter templates is fine
- Focus on learning, not originality

❌ **Perfect Code:**
- Minor bugs are acceptable if understood
- Code doesn't need to be production-ready
- Learning process is more important

❌ **Manual Coding Skills:**
- Not testing ability to write code from scratch
- Testing ability to work with AI tools effectively
- Focus on modern development workflow

## AI-Generated Code Detection

### Philosophy

**AI-generated code is expected and encouraged.** This course teaches students to use AI tools effectively.

### What We Look For

✅ **Positive Indicators:**
- Student documents prompts used
- Student can explain the code
- Student can modify and debug code
- Student shows understanding through README
- Student iterates and improves

❌ **Concerning Indicators:**
- Code works but student can't explain it
- No documentation of process
- Can't modify or debug code
- No understanding shown in README
- No iteration or improvement

### Assessment Strategy

**Focus on understanding, not originality:**
1. Review README for prompt documentation
2. Check code comments for understanding
3. Evaluate debugging process
4. Assess ability to modify code
5. Review reflection and learning

**Red Flags:**
- Perfect code but no understanding
- No process documentation
- Can't answer questions about code
- No iteration or improvement
